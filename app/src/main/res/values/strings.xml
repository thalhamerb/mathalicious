Each epic is split up into 3 sections with 9 levels in each.  Your goal is to collect up to 3 stars in each level by getting the highest score you can!  Epics and their sections have locks that are only opened when you have collected the number of stars shown on each lock.        \n\nEach level is unique!  They have an operation type (ie. add or subtract) and a score type (ie. points or character faces).  Each are explained before the game when you see them for the first time.  You can always press the back button to pause a level and look at the level\'s explanation if you need a reminder of how they work in the future!  In this pause screen, you can also get the level\'s info which has a general description of the level and what scores you need to collect each star.        \n\nThe rest you will learn as you go.  Well what are you waiting for!  Go meet Albert Einstein and start playing his first level.</string></resources>
