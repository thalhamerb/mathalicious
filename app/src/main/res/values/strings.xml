Each epic is split into 3 sections with 9 levels each.  Your goal is to collect up to 3 stars in each level by getting the highest score you can!  The more stars you collect, the more levels you unlock!        \n\nEach level has an operation (ie. add or subtract) and a score type (i.e. points or character faces).  They are explained before the game when you see them for the first time.  You can always press the back button to pause a level and look at the level\'s explanation if you need a reminder of how they work in the future.  In this pause screen, you can also get the level\'s info which has a general description of the level and what scores you need to collect each star.        \n\nThe rest you will learn as you go.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go meet Albert Einstein and start playing his first level!    </string>    <string name="intro_einstein">Hello!  My name is Albert Einstein.  I am well known for the work I did to explain gravity, how objects        behave at speeds approaching the speed of light, and how mass and energy are related.  In my level set, I will be guiding you through addition and        subtraction challenges.    </string>    <string name="glassDescription">        Glass - break by including tile in sequence with glass in front of it.
